Project: Python QR Code Generator
This project illustrates how to create a QR code in Python. It goes through the process of creating a virtual environment, installing the libraries needed, and creating a Python script that produces a.png image of a QR code.

Note: If you run into a permissions error on PowerShell, either:

Temporarily allow script execution (in terminal):
'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process'

Or run these commands from Command Prompt instead of PowerShell.
